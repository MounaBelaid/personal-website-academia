This is [the first Shiny application](https://mounabelaid.shinyapps.io/application/) that I've created. It’s powered by R software. You just need a text to copy and paste in the box then to click on the run button in order to create a wordcloud and obtain a table in a dynamic format that shows every word in the text and its frequency and don’t worry the text will be cleaned before displaying the wordcloud. That means punctuation and stopwords would be removed automatically. You can download the plot and save it as well. Don’t hesitate to give it a try!
