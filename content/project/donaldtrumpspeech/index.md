❝ January 20th, 2017 will be remerbered as the day the people became the rules of this nation again ❞ said Donald Trump. It was an unforgetable day for all the american people.

In this regard, I got the idea of analyzing the Donald Trump inauguration speech and I could not find a better software than R to obtain good results. I resort to Data Mining in order to create a wordcloud which resumes the main words said by the 45th President of the United States. Data Mining is one of the interesting techniques of exploring data. [See project](https://rpubs.com/mounabelaid/243878)
