[covid19tunisia](https://github.com/MounaBelaid/covid19tunisia) is the package that I have recently built in the programming language R.

The work I did is part of covid19R project that provides a single package that allows users to access all of the tidy COVID19 datasets collected by data packages (covid19nytimes_states, covid19nytimes_counties, covid19france, CanadaC19_cases, covid19us and recently mine was added) that implement the covid19R tidy data standard. To learn more about the Covid19R project, please check out [this documentation](https://covid19r.github.io/documentation/).

I'm very pleased to live such an experience and work on such an open source project that allows me to improve my skills on things worth doing. In fact, from the start of coronavirus spread in [Tunisia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia), I have been collecting daily data from the official sources that I explored by creating a [shiny application](https://mounabelaid.shinyapps.io/coronavirus/). After getting to know this project, I feel like it would be really great if I could explore more this data collected and share it with the R community.
