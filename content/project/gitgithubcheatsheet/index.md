I was happy to make a contribution of a new cheatsheet in support of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). 

The [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/git-github.pdf) covers the use of Git and GitHub in RStudio.

Many high quality cheatsheets on R topics have been generously contributed by R users and are available [here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

Some cheatsheets are also available in the RStudio IDE under Help > Cheatsheets

You may visit the Cheatsheet GitHub Repository by following this [link](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets).

If you would like to contribute a new cheatsheet, you may follow the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) which provide a useful starting place.

It's also possible to contribute to this effort by translating the available cheatsheets into many languages e.g. French, Arabic, Italian, Chinese, etc.
