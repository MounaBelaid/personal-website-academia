The [project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HiUm8a4vPK61Sc2kzC0T25psf-y9Nk8C/view?usp=drive_open) is about Brain Drain in Tunisia. A survey was conducted among
Tunisian people in order to get answers of several questions about this topic. As a team, we are
mainly interested in making analysis about two basic questions among all the questions being
answered :
✦ What are the reasons that would push you to leave Tunisia ?
✦ Socially, what’s the difference between Tunisia and abroad in social life ?

The text mining project pipeline is as follow :
1. Read questionnaire data from a csv file
2. Initialize raw corpus
3. Text cleaning
4. Text representation
5. Topic modeling
6. Clustering
7. Predictive modeling
8. Visualization and interpretation of final results

We resort technically to the language programming Python.
