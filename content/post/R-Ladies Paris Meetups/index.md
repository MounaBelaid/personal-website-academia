We are [R-Ladies Paris](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-paris/), a network of R practitioners in Paris. We are a local chapter of a global open source community promoting gender inclusivity in the R community worldwide, [R-Ladies Global](https://t.co/7HMQw0VGas).

Our goals are to provide a supportive and encouraging network for R users who identify as female and to promote learning and collaboration in the R community. We are open to anyone interested in programming in R, from experts to novices. Everyone is welcome to join us!

We aim to meetup in person or virtually to learn about the R programming language, algorithms and advanced tools using R. 

Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in working with R.

We exchange materials, discuss any issues we have on working with R, and share news and updates about R. We are really part of great community.

If you have missed our previous meetups, we are happy to share with you all the recording videos on our YouTube channel. Please have a look [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWTFKtW_ReLP9zmMTYjRqug) and don't forget to subscribe!

Please find below a list of the previous meetups organized by [R-Ladies Paris](https://twitter.com/RLadiesParis). You are welcome to join [our Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-paris/) to be notified about our next activities!

We are always open to collaborate on R-related subjects!
