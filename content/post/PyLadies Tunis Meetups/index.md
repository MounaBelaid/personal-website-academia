[PyLadies Tunis](https://www.meetup.com/pyladies-tunis/) is a local chapter of [PyLadies](https://pyladies.com/), an organization that promotes gender diversity in the Python community worldwide.

We are a group of Tunisian ladies passionate about Python programming.

We aim meetup in person or virtually to learn about the Python programming language, algorithms and advanced tools using Python. You might keep an eye out for [our Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/pyladies-tunis/).

Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in working with Python.

We exchange materials, discuss any issues we have on working with Python, and share news and updates about Python. We are really a part of great community. More details [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCllZITsohBLf1mbACmRQJhw)
