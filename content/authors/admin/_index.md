I'm a passionate engineer in Statistics and Data Analysis, graduated from [ESSAI](http://www.essai.rnu.tn/en/) and holding a research master's degree in Data processing and Complexity of Living Systems from [ENIT](http://www.enit.rnu.tn/fr/home/indexfr.php) and 
[Paris Descartes university](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qmbCrkuV33cTGxXUg2XpGjYXKNd5qQ6_/view?usp=sharing).

I work as a consultant in R at the [ArData](https://ardata.fr/) company.

I was working as a Data Scientist in [the Banking industry](https://www.biat.com.tn/) specialized in Credit Risk management. I'm experienced in using data science tools like R, Python and SQL to build data solutions.

Additionally, I was working Business Intelligence Consultant at [Prime Analytics](https://www.primeanalytics.fr/) based in Paris, France. My role consisted of proposing data solutions and strategies to business challenges after understanding customer requirements. I used technologies like Power BI, SQL, and Alteryx in order to make smart informed decisions. I'm also a Professional Scrum Master I certified.

I was also extremely happy to be selected as [a Diversity Scholar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KanOLRXW7GIuVtXTZMp3U_U1TLRJAAZ0/view?usp=sharing) in conjunction with [the rstudio::global virtual conference](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/11/30/diversity-scholarships/) in January 2021. This valuable scholarship gives me opportunities for online networking and support before and during the virtual conference. 

I use many programming languages and softwares for building data solutions. I love programming and building complex systems, but I also love organizing communities built on knowledge sharing. That's why I decided to combine these two, by co-foundering of three communities: [Tunis R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/tunis-r-user-group), [PyLadies Tunis](https://www.meetup.com/pyladies-tunis/) and [R-Ladies Tunis](https://tinyurl.com/fh8e9dn9).

I'm also delighted to be part of the [R-Ladies Global Team](https://rladies.org/about-us/team/) as being responsible for the Onboarding Process. I love participating in widening the R-Ladies communities worldwide. As it was said: "Those who are happiest are those who do the most for others." - Booker T. Washington

I'm also the community organizer of [R-Ladies Paris](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-paris/) and member of [Arab-R](https://arabr.github.io/) committee.

I'm so happy for being part of these great communities. These experiences are helping me to expand my network, meet amazing people worldwide, get inspired by them, and improve my R and Python skills.
