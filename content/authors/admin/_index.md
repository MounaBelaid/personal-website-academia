I'm a passionate engineer in Statistics and Data Analysis, graduated from [ESSAI](http://www.essai.rnu.tn/en/). Additionally, I have earned dual research master's degrees in Data Processing and Complexity of Living Systems from [ENIT](http://www.enit.rnu.tn/fr/home/indexfr.php) and 
[Paris Descartes university](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qmbCrkuV33cTGxXUg2XpGjYXKNd5qQ6_/view?usp=sharing). 

Throughout my professional experiences, I have gained proficiency in a variety of analytical tools, including R, Python, SQL, Alteryx, and Power BI. 

In addition, I'm certified as a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/index.html) instructor and hold a Professional Scrum Master I certification.

I began my career as a data scientist in the banking sector before moving to Paris.

In my current role as a Data Consultant at the French [ArData](https://ardata.fr/) consulting company, I specialize in using the R programming language. I'm involved in the creation of interactive data-driven web applications using Shiny, implementing effective data visualization practices, automating analytical processes, and providing training in R.

I was pleased to have been awarded the Opportunity 2023 Scholarship from Posit, and to have been selected as [a Diversity Scholar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KanOLRXW7GIuVtXTZMp3U_U1TLRJAAZ0/view?usp=sharing) in conjunction with [the rstudio::global virtual conference](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/11/30/diversity-scholarships/) in January 2021.

I use many programming languages and softwares for building data solutions. While I find great satisfaction in programming, my passion extends to fostering communities centered around knowledge sharing and collaboration. That's why I decided to combine these interests, by co-foundering of three communities: [Tunis R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/tunis-r-user-group), [PyLadies Tunis](https://www.meetup.com/pyladies-tunis/) and [R-Ladies Tunis](https://tinyurl.com/fh8e9dn9).

I enjoy engaging with the R community, where I also serve as the lead of the [R-Ladies Paris](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-paris/) chapter. Additionally, I'm part of the [R-Ladies Global Team](https://rladies.org/about-us/team/) team as being responsible for the Onboarding Process. I love participating in widening the R-Ladies communities worldwide. As it was said: "Those who are happiest are those who do the most for others." - Booker T. Washington

I'm grateful for being part of these great communities. These experiences are helping me to expand my network, meet amazing people worldwide, get inspired by them, and improve my R and Python skills.
