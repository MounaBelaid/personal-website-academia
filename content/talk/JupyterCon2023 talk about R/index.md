Folks at JupyterCon2023 did something great! They provided an opportunity for everyone who didn't have a chance to present or had an idea during the conference to give a lightning presentation about it. Talks were selected randomly, and mine was selected!

I was attending a Jupyter conference but couldn't resist thinking about the R programming language. That's why I briefly talked about how to create R Notebooks in Jupyter Notebooks.
