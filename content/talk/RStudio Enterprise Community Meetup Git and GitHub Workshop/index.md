I was so pleased to go live and animate a practical session about the first steps in learning the use of Git and GitHub in RStudio during a meetup organized by [RStudio Enterprise Community Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rstudio-enterprise-community-meetup/events/289074232/). 

This workshop served as an introduction to the use of Git and GitHub in RStudio. I was pleased to know that +140 people attended the session.
