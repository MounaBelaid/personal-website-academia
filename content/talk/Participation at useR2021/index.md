I was extremely delighted to participate in [useR!2021 - the R annual conference](https://user2021.r-project.org/) held online from 5-9 July 2021.

useR! conferences are non-profit conferences organized by community volunteers for the community, supported by the R Foundation. Attendees include R developers and users who are data scientists, business intelligence specialists, analysts, statisticians from academia and industry, and students. The useR! 2021 conference is the first R conference that is global by design, both in audience and leadership. Leveraging a diversity of experiences and backgrounds helps the participants to make the conference accessible and inclusive in as many ways as possible and to grow the global community of R users giving new talents access to this amazing ecosystem.

My main contributions are the following:

1. Co-author of the ["Data Visualization using ggplot2 and its extensions"](https://www.conftool.org/user2021/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=1#paperID300) accepted tutorial
2. Contribute in the ["Expanding the R community in the Middle East and North 
Africa (MENA)" incubator](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZZsIUKYyy0lGxd7IsZfFYsatwH9dK5qqr2_o9t9vL5k/edit#slide=id.gda9faf73b9_0_0)
3. Chair the ["4A - Trends, Markets and Models"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkjkny94dgU&list=PL4IzsxWztPdmHhzrXDAOpq4zS_peAVty2&index=5) session
4. Being a useR!2021 Marmot. I contributed in facilitating and getting the discussions going in the different rooms of the sessions. I invite you to follow [this link](https://user2021.r-project.org/blog/2020/11/26/welcome-margot-the-marmot/) to know about the idea behind having Margot, the Marmot.
