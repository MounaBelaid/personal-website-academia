I'm thrilled to have been a speaker at [ShinyConf 2024](https://www.shinyconf.com/shinyconf-2024/homepage), where I presented a Shiny web application that streamlines the conversion of RMarkdown files into Quarto. Quarto is an open-source publishing system for creating stunning websites, blogs, 
presentations, and more.
In addition, I was delighted to contribute as a volunteer moderator for several sessions during the conference, 
fostering engaging discussions and a smooth event experience.
