By following along with provided code, I experienced how one can perform predictive modeling and leverage graph analytics to model problems. This specialization prepared me to ask the right questions about data, communicate effectively with data scientists, and do basic exploration of large, complex datasets. In the final Capstone Project, developed in partnership with data software company Splunk, I applied the skills I learned to do basic analyses of big data."
