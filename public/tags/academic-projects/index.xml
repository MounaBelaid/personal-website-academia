      <title>Brain Drain reasons analysis, Text Mining in Sociology</title>
      <link>https://mounabelaid.netlify.app/project/braindrain/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HiUm8a4vPK61Sc2kzC0T25psf-y9Nk8C/view?usp=drive_open&#34;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; is about Brain Drain in Tunisia. A survey was conducted among
Tunisian people in order to get answers of several questions about this topic. As a team, we are
mainly interested in making analysis about two basic questions among all the questions being
answered :
✦ What are the reasons that would push you to leave Tunisia ?
✦ Socially, what’s the difference between Tunisia and abroad in social life ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text mining project pipeline is as follow :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read questionnaire data from a csv file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialize raw corpus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text cleaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text representation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topic modeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clustering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictive modeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualization and interpretation of final results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We resort technically to the language programming Python.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analyzing Donald Trump inauguration speech</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;❝ January 20th, 2017 will be remerbered as the day the people became the rules of this nation again ❞ said Donald Trump. It was an unforgetable day for all the american people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regard, I got the idea of analyzing the Donald Trump inauguration speech and I could not find a better software than R to obtain good results. I resort to Data Mining in order to create a wordcloud which resumes the main words said by the 45th President of the United States. Data Mining is one of the interesting techniques of exploring data. &lt;a href=&#34;https://rpubs.com/mounabelaid/243878&#34;&gt;See project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
