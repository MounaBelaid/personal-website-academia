      <description>&lt;p&gt;Folks at JupyterCon2023 did something great! They provided an opportunity for everyone who didn&amp;rsquo;t have a chance to present or had an idea during the conference to give a lightning presentation about it. Talks were selected randomly, and mine was selected!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was attending a Jupyter conference but couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist thinking about the R programming language. That&amp;rsquo;s why I briefly talked about how to create R Notebooks in Jupyter Notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;▶️ The replay is available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mouna-belaid_jupytercon2023-jupyter-r-activity-7062748353389842434-343W?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
